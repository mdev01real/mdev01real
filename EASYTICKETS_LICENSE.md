# Privacy Policy

EasyTickets does not sell your data. Privacy is our #1 concern and we want to improve your server's security.

We only take individual user data when you give us consent in our Support Server. This means that we only take certain user's data when they tell us we can. This does not include user IDs, tags, etc. We then use this data for testing purposes, and to improve our security as well as yours.

When you change the prefix or anything that involves saving to a database, we store your guild ID, the content needed to store, and sometimes the user ID of who ran the command. To have your data removed from our servers, simply join our support server and start a ticket thread `(#tickets)`. One of the developers will help you there.
